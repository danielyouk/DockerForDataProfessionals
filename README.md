![Course Image](./Docker.jpeg)
Welcome to our course on leveraging Docker for DevOps and Data Science, particularly focusing on infrastructure and machine learning platforms. This course is designed for beginners and includes hands-on practices with Docker to create a cloud-based deep learning analysis environment.

## What You Will Learn

- **Docker Environment Setup**: Learn how to set up a data analysis environment similar to Kaggle using Docker.
- **Cloud Connectivity**: Various methods to connect a powerful cloud computing environment to your local machine.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Techniques to minimize costs while using cloud services.
- **Linux Fundamentals**: Basic Linux commands necessary for understanding Docker.
- **IDE Container Features**: Utilizing container features in IDEs like VSCode, RStudio, and Jupyter Notebook.

### Course Features

- **Practical Docker Projects**: Focus on hands-on Docker projects to synchronize local and Azure cloud environments.
- **Performance Differences**: Observe noticeable performance differences between cloud and local setups.
- **Spot Discount**: Learn how to utilize cloud resources at a fraction of the cost using spot instances.
- **Dynamic Links**: Use dynamic linking to quickly access course materials and updates even after the course ends.

## Tools and Hardware

- **Visual Studio Code** is primarily used.
- **Cloud GPU Settings**: Applied on a Linux virtual machine, accessible from any local environment.
- **Compatibility**: Suitable for Windows, Linux, and MAC users.

## Course Outline

1. **Docker Commands**: Understanding and applying Docker commands using Docker's help feature.
2. **Dev Containers in VSCode**: Learn to set up a Python analysis environment using VSCode's dev container extension.
3. **Docker Image Creation and Deployment**: Practical sessions on creating and managing Docker images.

## After the Course

- Gain confidence in handling Docker-based projects.
- Overcome any intimidation of cloud services or Linux.
- Access high-performance computing resources at a minimal cost.

## FAQ

- **Do I need a GPU in my local setup?** No, a GPU is not required locally as the setups are cloud-based.
- **What OS can I use?** The course is compatible with any operating system.
- **Do I need to know R for this course?** While R is included to strengthen Docker command skills, the focus is on practical Docker usage for data scientists.

## Recommended For

- Data Engineers, Scientists, and Analysts looking to practically learn Docker.
- Developers and Engineers who wish to apply Docker in real-world scenarios.
- Anyone needing a practical portfolio in cloud environments.

We look forward to helping you scale your data science and devops skills using Docker and cloud technologies!
